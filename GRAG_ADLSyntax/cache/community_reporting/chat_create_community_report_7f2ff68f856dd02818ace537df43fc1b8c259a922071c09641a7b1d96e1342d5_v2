Its design ensures that data retrieval requests are properly handled and routed, which is essential for maintaining data integrity and operational efficiency. The centrality of REConnector is underscored by its direct relationships with both Reader and Readstorage roles, as well as its integration with the Rideshare system for data access [Data: Entities (68, 92, 93); Relationships (103, 104, 105)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Defined roles: Reader and Readstorage\",\n            \"explanation\": \"Within the REConnector framework, two distinct roles are defined: Reader and Readstorage. The Reader is tasked with initiating read requests and receiving responses, while Readstorage is responsible for storing and providing access to the requested data. This clear separation of responsibilities supports modularity and security, as each role can be managed and audited independently.
