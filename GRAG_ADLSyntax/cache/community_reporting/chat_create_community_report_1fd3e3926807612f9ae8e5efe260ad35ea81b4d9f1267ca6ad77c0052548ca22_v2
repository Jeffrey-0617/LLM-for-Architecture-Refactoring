These entities are tightly interrelated, forming the foundation for specifying and analyzing software architectures. Components encapsulate computation and expose Ports, which serve as interaction points.

Components define the boundaries of computation and expose interaction points, known as Ports, through which they communicate with other components or connectors. This encapsulation is crucial for modularity, reusability, and maintainability in software architecture. The definition of Ports within Components establishes a clear contract for interaction, which is essential for both design-time analysis and runtime behavior [Data: Entities (25, 26); Relationships (46)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Ports enable interaction and are central to component communication\",\n            \"explanation\": \"Ports in Wright# are defined within Components and serve as the primary means of interaction with the external environment. Each Port is described by a Process expression, which specifies the allowed sequences of events and actions at that interaction point. Ports are also the attachment points for Roles in connectors, enabling the flexible composition of system architectures. The dual role of Ports—as both interaction points and behavioral specifications—makes them a critical entity in the Wright# community [Data: Entities (26, 27); Relationships (44, 46, 47)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Roles represent participants in connectors and facilitate communication patterns\",\n            \"explanation\": \"A Role in Wright# represents an endpoint or participant in a connector, which is a construct that defines communication patterns between components. Roles are described by Process expressions, capturing the expected behavior of each participant in the communication. By attaching Ports to Roles, Wright# enables the specification of complex interaction protocols and ensures that component interactions conform to architectural constraints [Data: Entities (21, 27); Relationships (44, 45)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Process expressions provide formal behavioral semantics\",\n            \"explanation\": \"Processes in Wright# (and CSP) are behavioral entities that describe the sequence of events and actions performed by Roles, Ports, or Components. By associating each Port and Role with a Process expression, Wright# enables formal reasoning about system behavior, including properties such as deadlock-freedom, liveness, and safety.
