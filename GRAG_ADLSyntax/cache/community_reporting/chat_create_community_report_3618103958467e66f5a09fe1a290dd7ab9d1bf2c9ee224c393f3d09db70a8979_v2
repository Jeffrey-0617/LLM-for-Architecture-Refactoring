It manages communication between components by defining roles (client/server or requester/responder) and specifying the exchange of requests and responses through dedicated channels. This structured approach ensures that system components can interact reliably and predictably, which is critical for the integrity and maintainability of distributed systems. The prominence of CSConnector is evidenced by its high degree of relationships and its implementation of the Client-Server architectural style [Data: Entities (7); Relationships (16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 91, 92, +more)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Client-Server Pattern Implementation and Roles\",\n            \"explanation\": \"The Client-Server architectural style is implemented via the CSConnector, with explicit roles for Client and Server. The Client initiates requests and processes responses, while the Server receives requests, processes them, and returns responses.
